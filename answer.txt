Part 1: Theoretical Questions
Q1. List the steps involved in setting up a development environment for a web or
mobile web project. (10 points)
Q2. Explain the importance of using version control systems like Git in
collaborative software development. (10 points)

1.This is the steps that we need and working during build the project:
_set up environment like create repository github or bibucket to store project
_invite member of teams to github
_create trello or jira to makes plain to easy follow what are to working fo todad or tomorrow 
_standup meeting every morning to make sure who working for what and where have they been working
_follow up meeting with maneger or team leader to up date or new points that they need more
_help member teams on where that they difficail to work on we should help to them.

2.As i know about git i use to push, pull or merge code to github or bibucket. For the reason that i use it
because it can make us easy control code and push to repository. Example if i don't use git to push code 
to repository i will lost code in one day but if i use i will can see it in the future.

Part 3: Bonus Questions (Optional)
Q1. Describe the Git Flow branching model and its benefits in a team environment.
(5 points)
Q2. What are the key considerations when configuring a code quality control
utility? (5 points)

1.Git Flow branching:
_create branch name that we working on (ex: menu branch)
_when finish it need to commit and push to your branch name (menu branch) 
_and then merge your code from your branch name to branch main. because we need to
 merge code together with member on your teams
+For the benefits in teams are: Example in one company have developer 100 people build one website
and have work diffirent if we merge to only branch main it will can lost code or we don't know
what this or there code is. But if we create branch name follow our work like (menu branch) we will 
see the title of our work that working on.
